      "title": "How Sound Therapy Works",
      "description1": "Sound therapy uses specific frequencies and binaural beats to directly influence your brain's electrical activity. When you listen to two slightly different tones in each ear, your brain creates a third 'phantom' frequency—the binaural beat—that can guide your brainwaves into states of deep relaxation, focus, or calm.",
      "description2": "Different frequencies resonate with different parts of your nervous system. Theta waves (4-8 Hz) promote meditation and anxiety relief, while alpha waves (8-12 Hz) enhance relaxed alertness. The pure tones also create sympathetic vibrations in your body's tissues, promoting physical relaxation alongside mental calm.",
      "description3": "With consistent use, sound therapy can help retrain your nervous system's baseline state, making it easier to access calm even without the audio. Research shows these effects are measurable in brain scans, heart rate variability, and stress hormone levels.",
