      "title": "How Thought Labeling Works",
      "description1": "When you're anxious, your thoughts can feel overwhelming and completely true. Thought labeling helps you step back and see thoughts as mental events—temporary patterns in your mind, not absolute truths. By simply naming what you're experiencing (\"worry,\" \"self-doubt,\" \"catastrophizing\"), you create a small but powerful gap between yourself and the thought.",
      "description2": "This practice activates your prefrontal cortex—the rational, observing part of your brain—while reducing activity in the amygdala, the brain's alarm center. Instead of getting caught in a spiral of anxious thinking, you become the witness to your thoughts. This shift from \"I am anxious\" to \"I'm having anxious thoughts\" fundamentally changes your relationship with anxiety.",
      "description3": "With regular practice, labeling helps you recognize thinking patterns before they spiral. You'll start noticing: \"This is that catastrophic thinking again\" or \"Here's my perfectionist pattern.\" Recognition becomes your first line of defense, allowing you to respond skillfully rather than react automatically.",
