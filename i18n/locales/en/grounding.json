When anxiety activates your brain's threat-detection system, deliberately engaging each of your five senses creates competing neural signals that interrupt the anxiety response.",
            "description2": "By systematically identifying things you can see, touch, hear, smell, and taste, you shift your nervous system from a state of hyperarousal to present-moment awareness. This sensory engagement activates the prefrontal cortex—your brain's reasoning center—which helps regulate the amygdala, the emotional alarm system that triggers anxiety.",
