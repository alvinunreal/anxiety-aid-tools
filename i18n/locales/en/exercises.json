      "title": "What happens in your body",
      "description": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) works by teaching your body to recognize the difference between tension and relaxation. When you deliberately tense a muscle group for 5 seconds and then release it, you activate the relaxation response, which is the opposite of the stress response that contributes to anxiety and physical tension.",
      "physiology": "This technique leverages a natural physiological principle: after a muscle contracts intensely, it automatically relaxes more deeply than it would at rest. This rebound effect helps achieve a state of relaxation that's deeper than what you can typically reach through willpower alone. The systematic progression through different muscle groups ensures your entire body benefits from this relaxation response.",
      "awareness": "PMR also helps break the cycle of chronic muscle tension that often accompanies anxiety disorders. Many people hold tension in their shoulders, jaw, or stomach without realizing it. By systematically working through each muscle group, you develop greater body awareness and learn to release tension before it builds up.",
