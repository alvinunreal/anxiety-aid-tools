Activating this nerve sends signals that help transition the body from a \"fight or flight\" state to a \"rest and repair\" mode.",
            "description2": "This shift has several measurable physiological benefits. It can lead to a lower heart rate and reduced blood pressure. The relaxation of blood vessels allows for improved circulation, increasing oxygen flow to the brain. Furthermore, this calming response positively influences digestion and supports the body's immune system.",
