    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How Progressive Muscle Relaxation Works",
      "description1": "Progressive muscle relaxation teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation by systematically tensing and then releasing muscle groups. When you deliberately tense a muscle and then let it go, the release creates a deeper state of relaxation than the muscle had before tensing.",
      "description2": "This tension-release cycle activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which controls your body's rest-and-digest response. As each muscle group relaxes, your heart rate slows, blood pressure decreases, and stress hormones diminish, creating a cascade of calming effects throughout your entire body.",
      "description3": "With regular practice, you develop greater body awareness and can recognize tension earlier. This allows you to release physical stress before it accumulates, giving you a powerful tool for managing anxiety in real-time.",
