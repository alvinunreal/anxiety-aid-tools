    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How Guided Breathing Works",
      "description1": "Structured breathing patterns work by giving your nervous system clear, rhythmic signals that shift you from stress mode to calm mode. When you follow a specific count—like 4-7-8 or box breathing—you're taking control of an automatic process, which activates the vagus nerve connecting your brain to your heart and digestive system.",
      "description2": "Different patterns serve different purposes. Equal timing (like box breathing) creates mental clarity and focus by balancing your nervous system. Extended exhales (like 4-7-8) trigger deeper relaxation by activating your parasympathetic nervous system more strongly. Shorter patterns provide quick relief when you need immediate calm.",
      "description3": "The counting itself is therapeutic—it gives your mind something concrete to focus on, interrupting anxious thoughts while your body naturally follows the rhythm into a calmer state.",
